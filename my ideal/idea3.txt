using words recognization to control your army.your troops comprise severl kinds of 
soldiers, such as archars, lancers and rungers.the whole army should be in a battle form.
when you command, you could use your mouse and keyboard.but optionally, you could 
alse use your sound to command.the sene will be like this:
your want your archers to shoot the north enemy, and you just say: archers to select
and say attack noth rungers to make them shoot at the enemy's rungers on the north.
in addition to select your army by calling their type and position, you can also 
derictly call the general's name to select his troops whaterver the kind of the troop
is he leading and no matter where he is.
attack is the same. you can give the name of an enemy general or you just give the direction
to march or to attack.
this should be  supported by artificial intelegence so that the npc can undertand your
command from few simple words like "attack" or "move". npc should determine where or who is
the target that you realy want to locate.it needs npc to take the battle situation into 
account to make the final decision.
